# DM CLI

I play [Pathfinder](https://roll20.net/compendium/pathfinder/BookIndex) casually with friends about 3 times a year.

We aren't really strict about the rules and often make 'ad-hoc' rule changes.

Here is a CLI to help me DM for our loose application of the Pathfinder ruleset.

Sample npcs.csv
